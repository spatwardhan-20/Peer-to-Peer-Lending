# 1.	Introduction 
### a.Background 
Peer-to-peer lending is an innovative FinTech product that disrupts the entire banking industry. Traditionally, banks play an intermediary role between borrowers and lenders. Banks collect money from lenders as deposits or savings at a lower rate, then issue loans to borrowers at a higher rate. To protect lenders’ money, banks execute the professional due diligence that distinguishes good borrowers from bad ones. Recently, peer-to-peer lending fintech firms invented a platform that connects lenders with borrowers without these intermediary banks. It gives an opportunity for lenders to earn more returns and for borrowers to get loans in a cheaper and quicker way. 
### b.Audience and Motivation 
Even though peer-to-peer lending platforms give tremendous opportunities to both parties, the solution itself has its own drawbacks. The professional due diligence work is on lenders’ shoulders.  Not all lenders do not have the professional knowledge like banks to distinguish good borrowers from bad borrowers. Lenders are regular people who want to earn a high return on their loans.  If they invest in a bad loan, they would lose their money.  Therefore, we decided to develop a Machine Learning model to predict the probability of loan default and help investors to make better decisions.
